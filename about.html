        <h2>
            About Dacoda
        </h2>
    <p>Dacoda has a Bachelor of Arts degree in Math from the College of St. Benedict in 
        St. Joseph, MN.  She is now pursuing her Masterâ€™s Degree in Biomedical Engineering 
        at the University of Minnesota.  Her career goals point her to the prosthetics and 
        orthotics industry, either doing clinical work or research.
    </p>
        <h3>
            Accomplishments
        </h3>
    <p>One of her big accomplishments in college was being part of the Mayo Innovation 
        Scholars Program her senior year.  She also conducted research through another 
        grant program which allowed her to create a prosthetic arm prototype.  Another 
        big accomplishment was her ability to compete in sports at the collegiate level 
        after the three knee surgeries she endured while in high school.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Hobbies
    </h3>
    <p>In her free time, Dacoda enjoys running, reading, and juggling.  She considers 
        these activities to be her hobbies.  She was a sprinter for most of her track 
        career but now she is finding a renewed interest in distance running.  When she 
        is not studying for school, she enjoys reading science fiction, fantasy, and 
        adventure books, and practicing various juggling tricks.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Favorites
    </h3>
    <p>Dacoda enjoys her vacations at Disney World in Florida.  She is a big Green Bay 
        Packers fan so she would like to make it to a Packers game at Lambeau Field 
        someday.  Her favorite food is pizza and penguins are her favorite animal, mostly 
        because they are so cute.  
    </p>
    <p>Dacoda values the connections she has made with people throughout her life 
        (through sports, school, and her personal endeavors).  She finds that these 
        connections have helped shape her into the person she is today.
